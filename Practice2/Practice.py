
# Question1:  
# write a program to input 2 number & print their sum.

# Prompt the user to enter the first number and convert it to an integer
first = int(input("Enter your first number:"))

# Prompt the user to enter the second number and convert it to an integer
second = int(input("Enter your second number:"))

# Display the first number entered
print("First:", first)

# Display the second number entered
print("Second:", second)

# Display the sum of the two numbers
print("sum:", first + second)


# Question2:
#  write a program to input side of a square & print its area

# Prompt the user to enter the side length of the square and convert it to a float
Side = float(input("Enter square's side:"))

# Calculate and display the area of the square (side squared)
print("area =", Side**2)


 # Question3:
 #  write a program to input 2 floating point number & print their average.

# Prompt the user to enter the first number and convert it to a float
a = float(input("Enter first :"))

# Prompt the user to enter the second number and convert it to a float
b = float(input("Enter second :"))

# Calculate and display the average of the two numbers
print("avg =", (a + b) / 2)

# Question4:  
# write a program to input 2 numbers a and b.Print True if a is greater than or equal to b. if not print false.

# Prompt the user to enter the first number and convert it to an integer
a = int(input("Enter first :"))

# Prompt the user to enter the second number and convert it to an integer
b = int(input("Enter second :"))

# Compare if the first number is greater than or equal to the second and display the result
print(a >= b)
